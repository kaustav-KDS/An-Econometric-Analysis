# The Effects on Dropout Rates of Secondary School Girls in Indian States: An Econometric Analysis

Despite notable strides in elementary education, the dropout rate among secondary‐school girls in India remains alarmingly high, undermining both gender equity and the nation’s broader development goals. Persistent attrition at this stage not only curtails young women’s lifetime earnings and health outcomes but also perpetuates cycles of poverty and social disadvantage. While previous studies have highlighted individual factors - such as household income, parental education, and school infrastructure - few have brought these elements together within a unified econometric framework at the state level.

This study therefore addresses the following core question:

<em>“What socio‐demographic and infrastructural factors most strongly predict secondary‐school dropout rates among girls across Indian states?”</p>


By employing a panel of state‐level indicators - this paper seeks to quantify the relative importance of each determinant and thus inform targeted, evidence‐based policy responses.
